## IT System Description:

TechCo's existing IT system consists of a comprehensive infrastructure that supports the company's e-commerce operations and enables efficient data management. The system comprises various components that handle different aspects of the company's IT ecosystem. Here is an overview of the key components:

Transactional Database: TechCo utilizes a robust relational database management system (RDBMS) to store and manage its transactional data. The database system captures and organizes critical information such as customer orders, product inventory, payment details, and shipping information. The transactional database forms the backbone of TechCo's operational processes, ensuring accurate and reliable data for order processing, inventory management, and customer transactions.

- **Web Analytics Tools:** To gather insights into user behavior and website performance, TechCo employs web analytics tools. These tools capture and analyze data related to website traffic, page views, clickstream data, conversion rates, and user interactions. The analytics tools provide valuable information about customer preferences, marketing campaign effectiveness, and user experience, enabling TechCo to optimize its website and enhance customer engagement.

- **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System:** TechCo leverages a sophisticated CRM system to manage its customer relationships effectively. The CRM system consolidates customer data, including contact information, purchase history, preferences, and customer interactions. It enables TechCo to track customer behavior, personalize marketing initiatives, provide targeted recommendations, and offer exceptional customer service.

- **Inventory Management System:** To streamline its inventory operations, TechCo utilizes an inventory management system. The system tracks product availability, stock levels, and movements across multiple warehouses and distribution centers. It provides real-time visibility into inventory status, automates reordering processes, and optimizes stock replenishment, ensuring efficient inventory management and reducing the risk of stockouts or overstocking.

- **Data Integration Tools:** TechCo employs data integration tools to consolidate and integrate data from various sources within the IT ecosystem. These tools facilitate the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes, enabling the seamless integration of data from transactional databases, web analytics tools, CRM systems, external APIs, and third-party data sources. The data integration tools ensure data consistency, eliminate data silos, and enable a unified view of critical business information.

- **Reporting and Analytics Platform:** TechCo relies on a comprehensive reporting and analytics platform to extract insights from its data assets. The platform enables data visualization, ad-hoc querying, and the creation of customized reports and dashboards. It empowers business users and data analysts to explore and analyze data, identify patterns, and derive actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

These components of TechCo's IT system collectively contribute to the smooth functioning of its e-commerce operations, enabling efficient data management, informed decision-making, and seamless customer experiences. However, as the company faces challenges related to data growth, real-time analytics, data variety, scalability, data security, and data governance, an optimized big data architecture is required to address these challenges and propel TechCo towards enhanced data-driven capabilities.
