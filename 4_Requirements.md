## Requirements:

Based on TechCo's challenges and the nature of its business, the following requirements have been identified for the optimized big data architecture:

- **Scalability:** The big data architecture should be scalable to accommodate TechCo's growing data volumes and handle increasing user traffic. It should support horizontal scalability by seamlessly adding additional resources or nodes to the system as needed. The architecture should be designed to handle spikes in data ingestion, processing, and storage without compromising performance.
 
- **Real-time Analytics:** The architecture should enable real-time processing and analytics capabilities to support immediate insights and decision-making. It should provide the ability to analyze streaming data and perform real-time data processing for dynamic and time-sensitive use cases. The architecture should support low-latency data ingestion, processing, and visualization to ensure timely insights.

- **Data Integration:** The big data architecture should facilitate seamless integration of data from various sources within TechCo's IT ecosystem. It should support the integration of structured and unstructured data, including data from transactional databases, web analytics tools, CRM systems, external APIs, social media feeds, and third-party data sources. The architecture should enable efficient data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes to ensure data consistency and accessibility.

- **Data Security:** The architecture should prioritize data security and privacy to protect sensitive customer information. It should implement robust security measures, including data encryption, user access controls, authentication mechanisms, and audit trails. The architecture should adhere to industry best practices and comply with relevant data protection regulations, such as GDPR or CCPA.

- **Data Governance:** The big data architecture should incorporate data governance principles to ensure data quality, accuracy, and consistency. It should provide mechanisms for data profiling, data cleansing, and data lineage tracking. The architecture should support metadata management, data cataloging, and data governance frameworks to establish clear data ownership, accountability, and compliance.

- **Data Storage and Processing:** The architecture should provide efficient and scalable data storage and processing capabilities. It should support distributed storage systems, such as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) or cloud-based object storage, to handle large volumes of data. The architecture should enable distributed processing frameworks, like Apache Spark or Apache Flink, to execute complex analytics tasks and data transformations in parallel.

- **Analytics and Visualization:** The big data architecture should include tools and platforms for advanced analytics and data visualization. It should support machine learning algorithms, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling. The architecture should enable the creation of interactive dashboards, reports, and visualizations to empower users with actionable insights and facilitate data exploration.

- **Fault Tolerance and High Availability:** The architecture should be designed with fault tolerance and high availability in mind. It should have built-in mechanisms to handle failures and ensure uninterrupted operations. The architecture should provide data replication, automated failover, and disaster recovery capabilities to minimize downtime and data loss.

By addressing these requirements, TechCo can develop an optimized big data architecture that meets its data management and analytics needs, enabling the company to leverage its data assets effectively, gain valuable insights, and make informed business decisions.

Note: The case study can be further customized based on the specific focus areas and learning objectives of your workshop.
